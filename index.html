            <p>Somehow, you stumbled here! I'm Yuchen and I'm an undergraduate studying physics at Stanford. At the moment I'm interested in a lot of things; among them are climate dynamics, classical music, and rock climbing. I've carved out a little nook in the internet where perhaps I'll post some of my thoughts and explorations in the future. Coming soon... </p>
